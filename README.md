# Mathematical-modeling-of-virus-propagation
Mathematical modeling of computer virus propagation was performed, using SI, SIS, SIR, SEIR and variants of SEIR with the introduction of more factors for analytical modeling, including simulation codes and reports.

To run the code, `numpy` and `matplotlib` are required. You can use the command `pip install numpy matplotlib` to install them.
